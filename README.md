# Sorts
This repo like list of sorts which created on c#. \
I collect here all sorts which I know. Here only code and you need to re-write some of them by yourself. If you want to know something about sort - use Google ^_^ \
I need your help in:
- find more and add it
- improve existing 
- find mistakes 
sorry for my bad englishðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º
